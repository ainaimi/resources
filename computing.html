<h1>Accessing and Using Rollins HPC: A Basic Introduction</h1>
<div id="introduction-the-center-for-resource-computing"
class="section level4">
<h4>Introduction: The Center for Resource Computing</h4>
<p>The Rollins School of Public Health houses a computing cluster, and
if you are joining our research team, you will most likely have to use
it at some point in your analyses. This document is meant to help you
familiarize yourself with the basics behind using the Rollins computing
cluster.</p>
<p>To gain access to the cluster you must first open an account, and
acquire access to the Emory-VPN HIPAA core, which can be done by
emailing your advisor to request access (they will need an account).</p>
<p>Once your account is created, and clearance and VPN access is
obtained, you may access the computing cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="logging-into-and-exploring-the-cluster" class="section level4">
<h4>Logging into and Exploring the Cluster</h4>
<p>The cluster is a unix server that can be accessed from the command
line on your computer (e.g., Terminal on macOS). First, ensure you are
connected to the VPN. Next, open up the command line interface. This
includes Terminal on a Mac (or a Terminal emulator, such as Iterm2),
Terminal on a Linux machine, or Powershell on a Windows Machine. Once
open, you are interacting with the command line interface (CLI), or the
prompt from which you can access the cluster. To access the cluster, you
must login via SSH which can be done with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh [username]@clogin01.sph.emory.edu</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[username]</code> should be replaced with your user name.
If you enter the above on the command line (and are connected to the
VPN), you should be prompted to enter a password. If it’s your first
time logging on, you will need to follow the instructions in the above
user’s guide. Otherwise, use the password you set at your first login
and proceed.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with the unix terminal, you may find that when
you try to type in your password, it doesn’t work (i.e., nothing visual
gets typed into the console). However, you should know that unix/linux
systems do not provide any indication that there is a password being
entered (no dots or asterisks). For some context, see <a
href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/268006/why-is-the-password-i-entered-not-visible">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you enter the password, this should connect you to the cluster.
You will know that you have successfully connected when you see the
welcome page on your command line interface:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss1.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>At this point, you will need to use some basic commands to interact
with the Unix system. There are a lot of resources available on this
topic. The best I’ve found (so far) is the free book by Sean Kross:</p>
<p><a href="https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/"
class="uri">https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/</a></p>
<p>The more familiar you are with Unix commands, the easier time you
will have using the cluster. Here, I’m going to show you some basic ways
to interact with the cluster, and how to submit a job.</p>
<p>First we’ll get a sense of where we are on the cluster. If you use
the <code>ls</code> command, you will get a list of what’s in your
current directory:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss2.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This tells me that I have two folders in my login (or home) directory
R and test.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>pwd</code> command to figure out where we
are in the tree structure of the cluster:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss3.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>which tells us that my folder (<code>anaimi</code>) is located in a
home folder (<code>home</code>). We can move around from one directory
to another and explore using the <code>cd</code> command and then the
<code>ls</code> command. For example, to see what’s in the
<code>test</code> folder, I can use the <code>cd</code> command, which
stands for “change directory”:</p>
<pre><code>cd test</code></pre>
<p>When we do this, and then <code>ls</code> the files in the directory
we moved to, we get this:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss4.png" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This tells us that in our test folder (<code>~/anaimi/test</code>),
there are six files. This folder contains the examples we will be using
to get you familiar with the cluster in this group. The files containing
“_pitt” in their name were similarly used for similar purposes when I
taught at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Finally, for the sections that follow, it may be good to know that I
typically open two command line interfaces: one that is working in the
local directory that I have all of my relevant project files in, and the
other that is working on the cluster. On my local computer, this is what
my screen looks like:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss5.png" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="running-a-job" class="section level4">
<h4>Running a Job</h4>
<p>Running a job on the cluster can be broken down into four basic
steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Creating and testing the programs needed to complete the job.</li>
<li>Moving all data, files, and folders from your local computer to the
cluster.</li>
<li>Testing and running the job on the cluster.</li>
<li>Moving all results and data from cluster back to local
computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will explore each of these steps using a very simple example.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-local-tasks" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1: Local Tasks</h4>
<p>First you need the files and programs that make up your job. To keep
things simple, suppose we were interested in generating a csv file with
10 columns and 500 rows, with all values drawn from a standard normal
distribution. We can do this easily with the <code>MASS</code>
package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;MASS&quot;,repos=&#39;http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN&#39;)
library(MASS)
covariate_num &lt;- 10
N &lt;- 500
Sigma &lt;- diag(1,covariate_num,covariate_num)
set.seed(123)
res &lt;- mvrnorm(n = N, rep(0, covariate_num), Sigma)
write.csv(res,&quot;./simulation_results.csv&quot;,row.names=F)</code></pre>
<p>You should copy and paste this code into an R script, and save it as
<code>test.R</code>. Make sure to test that it runs on your computer.
Once this program successfully returns what you need on your local
computer, the next step is to move it to the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-moving-files-to-the-cluster" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2: Moving files to the cluster</h4>
<p>There are a number of different ways one can move files and folders
from a local computer to the cluster. If you are uncomfortable with the
command line, you should look into the following file transfer protocol
(FTP) applications. Two that I liked and used in the past include
FileZilla:</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/"
class="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/</a></p>
<p>and transmit:</p>
<p><a href="https://panic.com/transmit/"
class="uri">https://panic.com/transmit/</a></p>
<p>These applications allow you to easily drag-and-drop files from your
local computer to the cluster, but you must set them up appropriately.
Here, we will look at using secure copy, or <code>scp</code>. You will
first need to open up the command line with the directory pointing to
the location where your <code>test.R</code> program is. You can
<code>cd</code> directly into the folder with this program. On my
computer, this program is located in the
<code>~/ClusterFolder/RSPHC/test/</code> folder. To <code>cd</code> into
this folder and copy the test.R file to the Rollins cluster, I can use
the following commands (note that you must still be logged on to the
VPN):</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/ClusterFolder/RSPHC/test/
scp test.R anaimi@clogin01.sph.emory.edu:~/test/</code></pre>
<p>The above code says to secure copy the <code>test.R</code> file to
the <code>test</code> subfolder in the home directory
<code>~/test</code> of the <code>anaimi@clogin01.sph.emory.edu</code>
account. Once this code is run, you should be prompted to enter your
password. After you enter your password, you will receive confirmation
that the file was successfully copied:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss6.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>And we can now see this file on the command line as well:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss7.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-testing-and-running-the-job-on-the-cluster"
class="section level4">
<h4>Step 3: Testing and running the job on the cluster</h4>
<p>Now that the <code>test.R</code> file is on the cluster, we can begin
the process of testing and running it. There are many ways to test a
program on the cluster. Just keep in mind that when testing, you should
not use a program that will run for days, or use up all the computing
resources with heavy parallel runs. Instead, run only what you need to
confirm that you are getting the expected output, and nothing more.</p>
<p>First, to keep things organized, we’ll move our <code>test.R</code>
from the home folder to a sub-folder in home. To do this, enter the
following commands on the cluster’s command line:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir test
mv test.R test
cd test
ls</code></pre>
<p>The above code makes a folder (directory) called “test” (first line),
then moves the <code>test.R</code> file into the “test” folder (second
line), and then changes the CLI directory from “home” to “test” (third
line). The <code>ls</code> in the last line of the code above just
confirms that the <code>test.R</code> file is actually in the “test”
folder.</p>
<p>Next we can begin testing our program in the cluster environment. One
simple way to do this is to open R directly on the command line. To do
this, you need two simple steps. First, you have to ensure that R is
loaded in the cluster environment you are in. To do this, use the
<code>module load</code> command in the cluster’s command line:</p>
<pre><code>module load R</code></pre>
<p>Then, all you need to do is type <code>R</code> and press “enter”.
This should lead to the following display:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss8.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You can now copy and paste your code (from your local computer)
directly into the <code>R</code> console and run it as you would on your
local computer (note that to do this, you don’t actually need to scp the
file to the cluster, but it’s good to know how to use <code>scp</code>).
This is one way to evaluate whether any problems will occur when running
your job on the cluster.</p>
<p>Another way to test jobs is to actually run them through the batching
system that all users are required to use when running jobs. The process
occurs as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a shell script with the necessary arguments and options to run
your job</li>
<li>Run the shell script with <code>sbatch</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note there are many more details (plus some examples) on this how to
use <code>sbatch</code> (or more generally, SLURM commands, of which
<code>sbatch</code> is an example) available available in the User’s
Guide.</p>
<p>To run a job with the batching, we need to first write a shell script
with the arguments and options needed for our job. We can either write a
shell script locally (using, e.g., any text editor on your local
computer) and use <code>scp</code> to get it on the cluster.
Alternatively, you can open an editor directly on the cluster (e.g.,
<code>vim</code>) and write it there (click <a
href="https://www.openvim.com/">here</a>, <a
href="https://linuxconfig.org/vim-tutorial">here</a>, or <a
href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/">here</a>
for some tutorials on <code>vim</code>). For our <code>test.R</code>
job, here is an example shell script, which we’ll call
<code>test_run.sh</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=ashley.naimi@emory.edu
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --job-name=test_run
#SBATCH --mem=120g
#SBATCH --partition=short-cpu

module purge
module load R

Rscript test.R</code></pre>
<p>This shell script consists of three components: SBATCH options,
module loading, and script running.</p>
<p>The SBATCH options determine the characteristics of your job. In the
above script, the first two arguments tell the cluster to send me an
email with all information about my job (start, stop, error, cancel,
etc). The nodes option sets the number of nodes you will be using on the
cluster. Except in special circumstances, for the work done in our group
<em>this should almost always be one</em> (even when parallel
processing). The number of tasks per node option sets the number of
cores that will be used on each node. Typically, you would set this to
the maximum, which on the Rollins cluster will be 24 or 32.</p>
<p>The time argument is an important choice. Short time-jobs tend to get
bumped up in the queue (and thus there’s a shorter wait time for your
job to get started). However, too short, and your job won’t have time to
complete the job. This is typically one of the parameters I try to
estimate using trial runs, to project how long a full run will take. For
our <code>test.R</code> program, I selected 10 minutes because that is
plenty of time for this program to run to completion, and such a short
time wall will receive almost immediate priority.</p>
<p>Choosing the right memory threshold is also important. Too little,
and your job will stop and return an error. But there is an upper limit
to what the cluster can handle. Typically, however, I have found that
the cluster memory options are more than available to handle my jobs. If
your particular job is running into problems with memory, the Rollins
cluster has large memory nodes with up to 1.5TB of RAM. For details on
how to access these large memory nodes, please refer to the User’s
Guide.</p>
<p>Finally, the partition option is important to select appropriately.
There are five partitions on the Rollins cluster, each allocated to
accommodate programs with a certain run time. Details are on page 6 of
the User’s Guide.</p>
<p>The next section in the shell script tells the cluster which modules
you need to run your job. It’s important to start this section with
<code>module purge</code>, which clears up the environment, thus
avoiding potential conflict between modules.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to load R using <code>module load r</code>. Note
that we can also specify options here, which I sometimes do. To see
which modules are available to use, enter:</p>
<pre><code>module avail</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the command which runs the R program for our job is
<code>Rscript test.R</code></p>
<p>To run the shell script shown above (named <code>test_run.sh</code>),
you need to use the <code>sbatch</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>sbatch test_run.sh</code></pre>
<p>After you run this command on the cluster, you should get a
confirmation similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss9.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In this case, the job ID is 3240 You can check on the status of all
the jobs running on your account by typing:
<code>squeue -u $(whoami)</code>, which should provide you information
on the status of job 3240 (note that you will likely not see anything,
because the job runs so fast!).</p>
<p>If you selected the <code>mail-type=ALL</code> option, you should
also receive an email confirming that the job started (this might not
occur immediately because of your place in the queue). Similarly, you
should receive an email when the job ends as well, which will include
information on whether or not it ended successfully (ExitCode=0), or
with an error (ExitCode=1, 2, or other number).</p>
<p>Once the job finishes, you should see the output from the
<code>test.R</code> file in the folder where the job was run:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss10.png" width="500px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In the above figure, we see that we have the output from our
<code>test.R</code> file, (<code>simulation_results_rollins.csv</code>),
as well as a log file that capture any information relevant to our job.
We have now completed the task of running our job.</p>

<div
id="step-4-moving-all-results-and-data-from-cluster-back-to-local-computer."
class="section level4">
<h4>Step 4: Moving all results and data from cluster back to local
computer.</h4>
<p>The last step is to move all the relevant files from the cluster back
to your local computer. Again, this can be done with any FTP
application, or the <code>scp</code> command. To do this using
<code>scp</code>, you must have your command line pointed to a folder on
your local computer. In my case, I want to move the files on the cluster
back to the folder on my laptop. From a directory on your local
computer, use the following on the command line to copy files and data
from the cluster to your local computer folder:</p>
<pre><code>scp anaimi@clogin01.sph.emory.edu:~/test/simulation_results_rollins.csv .
scp anaimi@clogin01.sph.emory.edu:~/test/slurm-3240.out .</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to replace my user name with yours. Once you enter your
password for both commands, you will receive notification of the status
of the download:</p>
<p><img src="figures/ss11.png" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You should now have the simulation results on your local
computer.</p>
<p>Finally, note that important files and sensitive information should
not be stored on the cluster long term. Thus, be sure you have
everything you need on your local computer, and clean up the folder
space on the cluster.</p>
<p>To verify that you were able to successfully implement this exercise
on your own, run the test.R program on your computer and compare the
<code>.csv</code> file you obtain to the one you obtain from the run on
the cluster. Additionally, as long as you used the seed value of 123 on
your local and cluster runs, you can compare your output to the file
included <a href="./files/simulation_results_rollins.csv">here</a>. The
three should be identical.</p>
