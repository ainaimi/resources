## Notes

Notes from a Stats course at NC State. Among other things, useful equations for calculating simulation error, and other estimands:

## Books

Technical and challenging to read (for non-math/stats), but chapters 1-3 have been very useful to me:

1) Casella, George, and Christian P. Robert. "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods." (1999). Springer. New York, NY.
