  Comprehensive guide to designing and reporting simulation studies. Covers all aspects from setting aims to choosing performance measures and presenting results. Essential reading for anyone planning a simulation study.

- **Maldonado G, Greenland S. [The importance of critically interpreting simulation studies](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/1997/07000/the_importance_of_critically_interpreting.17.aspx). *Epidemiology*. 1997;8(4):453-456.**

  Brief but important commentary on how to critically evaluate simulation studies. Emphasizes that simulation results depend entirely on assumptions and highlights common pitfalls in interpretation.

- **Rudolph JE, Fox MP, Naimi AI. [Simulation as a Tool for Teaching and Learning Epidemiologic Methods](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/190/5/900/6039889). *American Journal of Epidemiology*. 2021;190(5):900-907.**

  Practical guide to using simulation for pedagogy in epidemiology. Explains how simulation can build intuition about statistical concepts and provides examples of teaching applications.

- **Burton A, Altman DG, Royston P, Holder RL. [The design of simulation studies in medical statistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.2673). *Statistics in Medicine*. 2006;25(24):4279-4292.**

  Detailed recommendations for planning simulation studies in medical statistics. Covers sample size determination, number of simulations needed, and how to structure simulation experiments.
