  Practical guide to analyzing survival data from trials with non-adherence. Explains how to estimate both intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects using g-methods, with clear worked examples.

- **Dablander F. [Introduction to Causal Inference](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/b3fkw). Preprint. 2020.**

  Accessible introduction to causal inference from a psychological perspective. Covers potential outcomes, DAGs, and various identification strategies with helpful visualizations and examples.

- **Naimi AI, Cole SR, Kennedy EH. [An introduction to g methods](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/756/2760169). *International Journal of Epidemiology*. 2017;46(2):756-762.**

  Gentle introduction to g-methods (g-formula, inverse probability weighting, g-estimation). Explains the motivation and basic mechanics of these methods for handling time-varying confounding.

- **Glass TA, Goodman SN, Hernán MA, Samet JM. [Causal Inference in Public Health](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124606). *Annual Review of Public Health*. 2013;34:61-75.**

  Overview of causal inference methods in public health contexts. Discusses both the potential outcomes framework and graphical approaches, with attention to practical applications.

- **Greenland S. [For and Against Methodologies: Some Perspectives on Recent Causal and Statistical Inference Debates](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-017-0230-6). *European Journal of Epidemiology*. 2017;32:3-20.**

  Thoughtful commentary on debates between different schools of causal inference. Greenland argues for pragmatic pluralism rather than methodological dogmatism.

## Intermediate/Advanced Articles

- **Cole SR, Hernán MA. [Constructing Inverse Probability Weights for Marginal Structural Models](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/168/6/656/145146). *American Journal of Epidemiology*. 2008;168(6):656-664.**

  Detailed guide to constructing IPW for marginal structural models. Covers practical considerations including weight truncation, model selection, and diagnostics. Essential reading for anyone using IPW methods.

- **Greenland S. [Randomization, Statistics, and Causal Inference](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3702552). *Epidemiology*. 1990;1(6):421-429.**

  Classic paper on the role of randomization in causal inference. Greenland clarifies what randomization does and doesn't guarantee, challenging common misconceptions about the relationship between randomization and causality.

- **Diaz I. [Machine learning in the estimation of causal effects: targeted minimum loss-based estimation and double/debiased machine learning](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/21/2/353/5511769). *Biostatistics*. 2020;21(2):353-358.**

  Overview of modern methods combining machine learning with causal inference. Explains targeted learning and double machine learning, two approaches that allow flexible ML while maintaining valid inference.
